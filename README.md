# User Guide
Organised  consists of 4 main sections: Marks, Time, Schedule and Tasks. Whilst navigating through the
system, keep in mind that you might need to complete one section before moving to the other. For example, add
years and modules in Marks and then move to study period addition in Time.

### First Launch

Using Organised for the first time you will have to register. The username and the password you use to create an
account will act as your login details to access Organised. To avoid logging in each time you launch Organised, make
sure you check the "Keep me logged in." checkbox.

### Profile
Your statistics. Populate Organised with information and see your profile update based on your progress.
The banner at the top changes based on the time of day.
  
### Marks
Add your Years, Modules & Assignments. When you complete your assignments, add your marks to Organised and get 
grade calculations for each module and each year. Note that:
- Values in Marks are rounded up, so minimal variation is possible;
- Grades in Marks are weighted according to given module credits and year percentages, where applicable;
- Degree classifications are indicative: it is based on the general UK Higher Education System guidance but can vary
based on university and not be the same in other countries;
- All Year modules are split evenly between Autumn and Spring semesters.
  
### Time
Add your Periods (such as Year 1 Semester 1, Year 2 Spring Vacation, etc.) and track how much time you
work during the day. Get statistics about each day and week and compare them amongst themselves or other periods.

Each Period is associated with a Year. A Year can be added in the Marks tab.

### Schedule
Add Events to your periods and get your schedule Organised. Such events as lectures, which repeat over 
multiple weeks, can be added as recurring events to save time. Note that:
- Organised time is UK time (GMT).

To use this tab, you'll have to have Periods created. You can create a Period in Time tab.

Events have to be associated with a module. In case your event is neutral *(e.g. Trip to the beach)* add a module
for such occasions *(e.g. Free time)* in the Year, which is associated with the Period the Event is to be added to.
  
### Tasks
Add Tasks to your periods & weeks and always be Organised with your activities. Tasks which need to be 
repeated in multiple weeks can be added as recurring tasks-in the same manner as events. Observe your 
progress and know what needs to be done when.

To use this tab, you'll have to have Periods created. You can create a Period in Time tab.

Tasks have to be associated with a module. In case your task is neutral *(e.g. Clean computer screen)* add a module for
such occasions *(e.g. Housework) in the Year, which is associated with the Period the Task is to be added to.

Tasks can be Completed, Not Completed or Dropped. A dropped task is a task which was meant to be completed, but has
been discarded for some reason. A dropped task does not impact the progress bar of tasks completion in any way.
